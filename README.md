# Rep-U

This project is an experiment in composable identity & reputation that remains private.

# The problem
Hyperfinacialasion of blockchain technology has developed a capital-based reputation system. The value of a community is in the reputation of its members, some will have acquired capital-growing skills others will have acquired expertise in other areas.

Reputation should be sharable, sharable is intrinsically a choice, it is private until it is shared. Someone's Identity is made up of intrinsic factors such as gender, age, race, sexuality, etc. It also consists of their experiences and experiences lead to reputation. An individual should be free to share some or none of this information.

# The solution
That's what we are here to find.
My proposal is a ZK reputation system where identity and reputation can be composed and shared as a choice of the user.

For example, a social platform requires you to be over the age of 13 to sign up. We can have a ZK identity token which when queried about age can confirm whether the user is over the age of 13, without requiring to specify a birthdate.
